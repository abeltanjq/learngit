To learn and practise the industry standard of using git.

## GitHub Flow
Based on https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/
1. Create a new project or clone from an existing repository.
2. Create a separate branch to work on a new feature or fix.
3. Add commits to your newly created branch as you edit your files.
    * **Do not** commit into `master` branch while working on new features or fixes. `master` is only used for deployment.
4. Open a pull/merge request.
