To learn and practise the industry standard of using git.

## Git Flow
Based on https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/
1. Create a new project or clone from an existing repository.
   ### For Existing Repository
      * There are **2** important branches
      1. `master`
      2. `development`
   ### For New Project
      The `master` branch will be created by default.  Now, create a `development` branch.
2. Create a new branch to work on a new feature or fix an issue.  **NOTE**: This is not the same as `developement` branch.
3. Add commits to your newly created branch as you edit your files.
    * **NOTE**: *Do not* commit into `master` or `development` branch while working on new features or fixes. `master` is only used for deployment.
4. Open a pull/merge request.
